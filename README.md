## Overview

We'll design a login page using HTML and CSS. A login page in HTML collects information from the user and has a submit button to send the details for server-side operations. However, our objective here is to design a login page and not to deal with the backend tasks.

## Pre-requisites
- HTML forms
- CSS
- Flexbox and its properties

## What Are We Creating?

The login page uses HTML and CSS for the structuring and styling. We'll first create the simple structure with HTML and then move to make it look great with CSS. This is what our final output will look like:


## HTML

We’ll start with the HTML, as it is the one responsible for the information displayed on the page. In other words, first, we will write and structure all the information contained in the page without worrying about style (CSS) or interactivity (JavaScript). Analyze the complete HTML file for as long as you want and when you’re ready move on to the explanation. <br>

As usual in HTML files, we have two parts: the <head> and the <body>. The former includes metainformation about our web page, like the character encoding used, the title of the page (the name you see in the tab of your browser), and references to the CSS and JavaScript files that this HTML file will make use of. Note that there’s a defer attribute in the <script> tag so that the JavaScript script is only executed after the HTML is fully loaded. 
  
## CSS
Now we have the CSS, in other words, the style of our page. To modify each element in our HTML file, we can select them using ids, classes, or the tag names themselves, though the last option is discouraged. You see, the styles of more specific CSS selectors overwrite the styles of less specific ones. For example, the styles of an id selector overwrite those of a class selector, and class selector styles overwrite those of a tag name selector. In other words, always make your CSS selectors as specific as possible to affect only the elements you want to be affected.
